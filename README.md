## --- Legacy Elements ---
### All legacy element widths were changed to match the new/updated element widths.

### Matrix
  * **Q-Bone:** Should theme colors apply to this element as well? If so, how should they be applied?

### Image Comparison
  * Right side label is showing even when the image is minimized. I think I need to fiddle with z-index on this.

### Multiple Choice Comparison
  * One selection
  * Multiple selections

### Student Upload
  * This literally does not do anything right now.

### Media Switcher
  * Selected tab has an opacity of 50%.

### News Judge
  * **Q-Bone:** Tablet view sizing-- In legacy elements, there was no difference in size on the sliders for desktop and tablet. They look kind of bulky here though.
  * ~*All sliders are currently starting at a value of 10, need to adjust this to start at no value.*~

### Category Choice (formerly Infozone)
  * Button colors will be customizable for this element, but will default to theme colors if custom is not specified.
  * This element has a function that validates hex codes. If an invalid hex is entered, button will fall back to theme colors.

### Passive
  * Media title is left aligned here.
  * Headings are center aligned here.
